https://www.codewars.com/kata/complete-the-pattern-number-5-even-ladder

##Task:

You have to write a function **pattern** which creates the following pattern upto n number of rows. 

* If the Argument is 0 or a Negative Integer then it should return "" i.e. empty string.

* If any odd number is passed as argument then the pattern should last upto the largest even number which is smaller than the passed odd number.

* If the argument is 1 then also it should return "".

##Examples:

pattern(8):

    22
    4444
    666666
    88888888
    
pattern(5):
 
    22
    4444



```Note: There are no spaces in the pattern```

```Hint: Use \n in string to jump to next line```

"""


def pattern(n):
    return '\n'.join(str(i) * i for i in range(2, n + 1, 2))
