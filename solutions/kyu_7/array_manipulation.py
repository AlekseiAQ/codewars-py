"""Array Manipulation
https://www.codewars.com/kata/array-manipulation

 Given an array of positive integers, replace every element with the least greater element to its right.
 If there is no greater element to its right, replace it with -1. For instance, given the array 
 
 `[8, 58, 71, 18, 31, 32, 63, 92, 43, 3, 91, 93, 25, 80, 28]`,
 
 the desired output is 
 
 `[18, 63, 80, 25, 32, 43, 80, 93, 80, 25, 93, -1, 28, -1, -1]`.

Your task is to create a function "arrayManip()" that takes in an array as its argument, manipulates the array as described above, then return the resulting array.
