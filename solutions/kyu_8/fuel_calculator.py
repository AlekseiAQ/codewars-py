"""Fuel Calculator 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/fuel-calculator

In this kata you will have to write a function called `fuelPrice` (`fuel_price` in PHP) that takes `litres` and `pricePerLiter` as arguments. Purchases of 2 or more litres get a discount of 5 cents per litre, purchases of 4 or more litres get a discount of 10 cents per litre, and so on every two litres, up to a maximum discount of 25 cents per litre. But total discount per liter cannot be more than 25 cents. round answer to 2 decimal places. Also you can guess that there will not be negative or non-numeric inputs.

!Good Luck!

def fuelPrice(litres, pricePerLiter):
    discount = min(litres // 2, 5) * .05
    return round(litres * (pricePerLiter - discount), 2)
